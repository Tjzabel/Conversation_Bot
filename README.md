## Weather Bot
# By: Tim Zabel <Tjzabel21@gmail.com>

This weather bot, when requested by another Twitter user, will respond with the correct weather report from the user's location.

The goal of this project is to get familiar with the Dark Sky weather API. At the moment, this project has been put on hold, and
will resume once my current project are either finished, or put on hold themselves.
